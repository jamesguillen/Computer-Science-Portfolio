<div id="marquee"><h1>What this class is about?</h1></dv>
<p id="this">This class is about learning to understankkd computers. Computers are used in many ways to make our lives better and the more we understand how they work and what they are capable of,<br> the more they can be utilized by everyone. In this class we learn how to code and eventually end up doing a project, either making your own website or creating our own game. I believe computer<br> science is important because it provides information that is easy to access on the internet without breaking a sweat. Computer science is used to make websites, games, etc.</p>
